     *
     * @param psmContent Content of a PSM-file generated by upstream tools (such as MS2Rescore).
     * @param alphas An array of possible values for the alpha parameter. This parameter indicates the probability that an
     * observed taxon also indicates the presence of a peptide.
     * @param betas An array of possible values for the beta parameter. This parameter indicates the probability of
     * detecting a peptide at random.
     * @param priors An array of possible values for the gamma (or prior) parameter. Gamma indicates the prior probability
     * of a taxon being present.
     * @param progressListener Is called everytime the progress of the belief propagation algorithm has been updated.
     * @return Mapping between NCBI taxon IDs (integer, > 0) and probabilities (float in [0, 1]).
