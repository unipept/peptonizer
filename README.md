# Peptonizer2000 - Integration into Unipept

## Chain of operations
In order to compute the probability that a specific taxon is present in a metaproteomics sample, the Peptonizer2000 goes through a whole chain of different operations.
This section highlights each of the different steps that are performed and how these are interconnected to each other.

### Input
The following data is required by the Peptonizer as input and are then used during the analysis pipeline to transform the input into the required output probabilities:
* A file containing "rescored" PSMS, use MS2Rescore to transform your input to something that can be fed into this pipeline.
*
